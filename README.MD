This project is used to enhance the communication in China.
As you know the GFW that all the message are under monitoring and this tool can help to setup a private IM lan and all the members can chat and feel free.

Somehow it was originally coding via nodejs and I am going to use VUE to optimze the user interface. Just left a pin here.

Here are the comming to-do list:

- electron implementation for user interface
- SSL for chat over websockets

Thanks
